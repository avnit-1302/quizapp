# Startup

## .env variables

```ini
SERVER_PORT =

DATABASE_URL = {REQUIRED}
DATABASE_USERNAME = {REQUIRED}
DATABASE_PASSWORD =
DATABASE_DRIVER = {REQUIRED}

KEY_NAME = {Required if USE_SSL is true}
CERT_PASS = {Required if USE_SSL is true}
USE_SSL = false

JWT_SECRET = {Required}
```

### env example>

```ini
SERVER_PORT = 8080

DATABASE_USERNAME = root
DATABASE_PASSWORD =
DATABASE_DRIVER = com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

KEY_NAME = {Required if USE_SSL is true}
CERT_PASS = {Required if USE_SSL is true}
USE_SSL = false

ADMIN_USER = You create a username
ADMIN_PASS = You create a password

JWT_SECRET = {Required}
```

### To generate a JWT_SECRET securely

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

jwt.secret=${JWT_SECRET}
```

## Running Backend with Docker

The easiest way to get the backend up and running is using Docker. This method will automatically set up both the MySQL database and the Spring Boot backend application.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Steps to Run

1. Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```
2. Start the application using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up
```

This command will:

- Pull two Docker images:

  - MySQL latest version (database)
  - jannordskog/springapimobilapp:latest (backend API)


- Create and configure the necessary volumes for data persistence
- Set up the required network connections
- Start both services with the correct configuration

The backend API will be available at:

http://localhost:8080 (or your machine's IP address:8080)

### Verifying the Setup
You can check if both services are running properly using:
```bash
docker compose ps
```
To view the logs:
```bash
docker compose logs
```
To stop the services:
```bash
docker compose down
```

Note: When you run docker compose down, the database data will persist thanks to the volume configuration. If you want to completely reset everything, you can use:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Updating Docker Image

When you make changes to the backend code, follow these steps to update the Docker image:

1. Build a new version of your Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t jannordskog/springapimobilapp:latest .
```
2. Push the updated image to Docker Hub:
```bash
docker login
docker push jannordskog/springapimobilapp:latest
```
3. If your containers are running, stop them:
```bash
docker compose down
```
4. Pull the latest version and restart:
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up
```
Alternatively, you can do a one-line update and restart:
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose pull && docker compose up
```
Note: Make sure you're logged into Docker Hub with an account that has permission to push to the jannordskog repository.
